# useful-functions
Here I post some useful functions in NodeJS that I made with the Discord.js API 

I made this for study purpose and sharing with people some of my knowledges.

I will try to send my functions in the cleanest possible way that I know, and correct them every time I can, the purpose of this is to learn to make my functions readable for others.

I will upgrade every functions every time I found a new way to make those functions. 

Some of my functions will be connected to each other.
